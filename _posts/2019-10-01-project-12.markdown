description: <h2>Breif Overview</h2> A triangular mass falling in gravity constrained to move in a circular path goes in impact with a rotating windmill.This system consists of two independent rigid bodies.<ul><li>The rotating windmill is a single DoF body consisting of three rectangular plates joined at the center of one of the edges.</li><li> The triangular mass is a 3 DoF system and it is free falling in gravity but it is constrained to move in a circle.</li></ul> The impact of windmill on the traingular mass is modelled but the impact of triangular mass on the turbine is not modelled. The turbine is modelled to be a very heavy body and triangular mass is much smaller when compared to turbine so that this assumption is meaningful.Therefore,  the trainagle doesn't  cause any changes through impact to the dynamics of the turbine. But the dynamics of the triangular mass is altered through impacts with the windmill and that is the heart of the project.<h2> Frames setup</h2> A figure showing all frames used in the project is shown below<br><br><img src="./img/portfolio/dynamics_frames.jpeg" width=560 class="center"><br> Each rectangle in the windmill has a frame and its transformation is given in the figure. The windmill as a whole is a one DoF system and is pivoted at the point X=5, Y=5. The angle between each of the rectangle is 120 degrees. The triangular mass is a 3 DoF system and it has direct transformation characterised by x,y and \(\theta_2\) with respect to the world frame. The triangle is assumed to be equilateral. Not all of these frames are important in lagrangian computation. Some of these frames have been specifically setup for handling impact conditions. Its very easy to define phi conditions for impact if we setup a frame that is aligned with each of the sdies of impact. Frames s1, s2, s3, b1, b2, b3 are used in writing down the equation and limits of impact phi surfaces while b1c, b2c, b3c and t are useful in writing down the lagrangean of the system <h2> Lagrangian setup</h2> The Lagrangrean for the system consits of writing down potential and kinetic energies of the four bodies (three rectangles and one triangle). Gravity is pointing in the negative y direction. So the lagrangian consists of 4 PEs and 4 KEs, one each for each of shapes (3 rectangles and 1 triangle)<br><br> <h4>Number of degrees of freedom</h4> 4 (\(\theta_1, \theta_2, x, y)\)<br><br><h4>Constraints</h4>The triangle is contrained to move in a circle. This circle is centered at (5, 13) and has a radius of 5<br><br><h4>Impacts</h4>Turbine impacts the triangular mass. In order to achieve this, I had to keep track of 12 edges for the phi surface (9 edges of rectangle + 3 edges of triangle, the pivoted edges of rectangles are ignored because they never involve in impact) and 9 points ( 2 points from each rectangle and 3 points from triangle, the two points on the pivoted edges of the rectangle don't involve in impact). In all I had to check for about 45 impact conditions but I should downplay this exaggeated number by stating that all of them revolve around just 2 or 3 key ideas. The impact update law used is for this work is shown below.<br><br>\(-[H]^{\tau+}_{\tau-}=0\)<br><br>\(\frac{\partial L}{d\dot{q}}{\bigg\rvert}^{\tau+}_{\tau-}  = \lambda_I \nabla\phi_I(\epsilon)+ \lambda_p \nabla\phi_p(q)\)<br><br>\({\frac{d}{dt} \phi_p(q)}{\bigg\rvert}^{\tau+}_{\tau-} = 0\)<br><br> I have used two lambda terms  \(\lambda_I\) and  \(\lambda_p\) corresponding to two constraints on the generalised moementum after impact in  the impact update, because I needed the path constraint for the trianglar mass to be upheld even after impact.<br><br> <h4>External force / Torque</h4> The windmill is driven by a external torque. This torque is applied to the \(\theta_1\) when solving EL equations of the system.<br><br> Feel free to check out the code in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wBqgbCS2MAZy1PqR2_w96NRRAnoMrOx3" target="_blank">colab</a>.
