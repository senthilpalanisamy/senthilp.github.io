description: <h2> Brief Description </h2>  This is a project I worked in Soliton, where we deliver R&D as a service. Due to Non-Disclosure Agreements we had with the customer, I had cannot reveal any part of the algorithm design. I am just going to state what part I worked in this product, when delivered some parts of this software as a service. <br><br> <h2> My role in this project</h2><ul><li> I was a part of the team that developed an algorithm that synthesizes adaptive background for a given album page by picking up colors from all the photos in the page. This was done by Filtering colors according to a definition (which cannot be revealed, because that's propriety of the company)and quantiszed them to pick colors and used them to synthesize a  background. </li><li>Developed an algorithm for placing decoration objects according to the rules defined by the aesthetics associated with each of them. Came up with a mathematical formulation to measure the aesthetics and storytelling value of a picture.<br><br> For more details on the product, visit the <a href="https://www.gomagicbook.com/" target="_blank">product</a> website. This is one of those rare projects, where I am going to state this - " Please don't get in touch with me if you need to know more on this because I cannot reveal more than what I have written here"
