description: <h2> Brief overview</h2> There are a lot of short term projects I worked in my previous work experience, for which I cannot showcase the work outside due to the non-disclosure agreement involvement in those works. Nevertheless, I am briefly stating the work experience I had in each of those projects<br><br><h2>Deep Learning based projects</h2> In these ages, a computer vision Engineer doesn't exist without knowing deep learning. I worked on a couple of deep learning based porjects<br><br><h4>Image Depth Categorisation based on deep learning</h4>Images have to be classified into one of four categories- Close-up, Medium, Long and Ultralong range shot. I generated depth maps for a given image based on pre-trained monocular depth estimation models and constructed a four channel RGBD image by appending the depth map to an RGB image. Then I trained different existing dDeep Learning architectures on 4D images and fine-tuned a model based on ResNet-50 to achieve an accuracy of 85%.<h4>Weed detection and distance estimation using calibrated camera</h4> Trained a weed detection model using tensorflow object detection api. Calibrated the extrinsic parameters of the rover camera with respect to a checker board placed on ground. Found the 3D point that lies at the intersection of ground plane and inverse projection ray (that corresponds to the bottom most pixel of weed). Estimated the distance of the rover to the point using known transformations.<br><h2> Classical Vision Projects</h2><br><h4> Shape Context matching as a post-processing to improve Deep Learning HCR accuracy</h4> This is not a real deep learning project but an effort to improve the DL model performance.I improved the accuracy of an AlexNet HCR model from 90.1% to 91.2% by overriding deep learning outputs by shape context-based matching results only for images where the deep learning network was struggling to classify due to very low confidence.In order to achieve this, I had a database of hand written characters to compare against and whenever the deep learning model was not confident enough, I overrode deep learning predictions with Shape context based prediction. To achieve this,  I measured the Hausdorff distance between the shape context approximation of the given image and shape context approximation of every image in the database and found the best match (The image with the lowest hausdroff distance with using shape context features.) I Sped up this computation by 3x using parallel processing.<br><br><h4>Improving Casting and Bagging Automation system</h4>This is a Jewelry component identification system consisting of 85,000 different Jewellery parts. The existing pipeline that was in action consisted of a size filter(filtering based on contour area), hu moments filter followed by pattern matching.To improve the overall system accuracy, I proposed two changes based on ablative analysis- Using Zernike moments instead of Hu and ORB feature matching instead of pattern matching improved the overall recognition accuracy from 55% to 80%.<h4> Iris recogniton</h4>Developed an end to end iris recognition system involving image acquisition through Soliton smart camera, Iris localization by Daugmanâ€™s transform, image normalization and unwrapping, encoding by Gabor wavelets and matching by L2 distance. I didn't really develop any of these algorithms from sratch in this case. I just integrated all the open source code to get a system working. <br><br><h2>Tools/ Non-CV project</h2><h4> Dataset Generator</h4> The objective behind this project was to develop a tool that will lower the human effort in data collection. The basic idea was to collect images and auto-tag some of them using on-the-fly machine learning models. Thus this tool runs a weak model automatically on the labeled data collected so far and auto-tags some images within the dataset, which it believes with extreme confidence.<br><br><h4> Pin Map Generation</h4> The objective in this project was to find a pin mapping between two devices based on netlist connection given. To do this, I generated a graph representing circuit connections for a given netlist. Then I found the pin mapping between any two terminals  present in the circuit by applying shortest path algorithms on the generated graph. This problem setup is challenging particularly because the graph nodes are not simple nodes but electronic components. So electronic circuit knowledge needed to be incorporated to define connectivity between nodes.<br><br>
