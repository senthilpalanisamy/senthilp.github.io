description: <h2> Brief Description </h2> This project was done as a proof of concept for monitoring if drivers always wear seat belt in lorries. I trained machine learning based object detector for achieving this objective. These algorithms were not coded from scratch. They were coded using OpenCV and SKlean libraries.<br><br> <h2>Algorithm Description</h2><ul><li>This is a sliding window detector that classifies each window using a SVM classifier trained on HoG features</li><li>To generate training set, 2000 image frames were extracted from a video and each frame was annotated with a Ground Truth bounding box of Seat Belt.</li><li> Then a viewing window size was defined and all possible windows were generated by sliding window mechanism. For each window HoG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) were generated and given a Supervised label of "Seat Belt Detected" or "No Seat Belt Detected". All windows which have at least 90% IoU (Intersection Over Union) with the ground truth bounding box annotation of seat belt were given "Seat Belt Detected" label while others were given "NO Seat Belt Detected" label</li><li> After the first set of training, to improve the performance further, hard negative mining was performed (Where many mis-classified were added back to the training dataset)</li> <li> To improve the quality of the existing data, data augmentation was performed. It must be noted that the type of image augmentations chosen should be thought along with the actual problem in hand. Sometimes, we may end up making the problem more difficult than it actually is by introducing variations that are unlikely to occur in the real use case. This will, in fact bring down the performance from the optimal performance which could have been achieved with carefully chosen variations that fit the problem description </li><li> Finally, since we will end up getting multiple detection, I ended up doing Non-Maximum suppression, where multiple local detection are merged into a one peak maxima detection.</li><li> The final IoU of the detector turned out to be 75%</li></ul><br><br>. A few more videos showing outputs are shown below.<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/42qybhjpUBk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4IZcE65EVds" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23CCyuAoDe8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
