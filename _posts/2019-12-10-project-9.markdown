description: <h2> Brief Description</h2> This project was done during MSR hackathon. The objective was to assemble and control a two Degree of Freedom Pan-tilt mechansim that uses comptuer vision for tracking and following a Blue cube<br><br><h2>Detailed Overview</h2><ul><li>As a first step, I assembled the two servos into a pan-tilt mechanism</li><li>Next, after soldering the Pololu Micro-maestro board, I installed its drivers and wrote python wrappers that allowed me to control the pan-tilt servos by specifying a trajectory sequence of angles for both servos</li><li> Finally, to achieve the vision based control, I wrote a OpenCV based tracker. Initally, the blue cube is found by masking the blue color and filtering contours based on pre-defined contour properties. Once the cube is detected, it is then tracked using a CSRT tracker through successive frames. The center of the contour defining the blue cube is used for achieving the control. The pixel disparity of the contour center from the image center is calculated in both X and Y direction. The angle of view of the camera was calculated and then the pixel disparity was conveted to proportional angle disparity and this angle was then used a feedback to adjust the pan and tilt servo until the ball was nearly at the center of the image</li><li> One complexity that is worth mentioning is the need to invert camera image when the tilt swithces from positive to negative values so that the servo control can be the same at all pan-tilt configurations</li></ul> A video showing the whole output is shown below <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hftMyb5vug" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br> Feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/senthilpalanisamy/msr_assignments" target="_blank">code</a> in github.
