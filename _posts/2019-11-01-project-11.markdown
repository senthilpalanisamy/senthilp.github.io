description: <h2> Brief Description</h2> I, along with my team in Soliton Conducted three workshops on Computer Vision between 2016-19. I have listed the ppts, link to github repo and the parts I handled for each workshop here. Over the years, I have handled Machine learning and Deep learning in the context of computer vision and fundamentals of projective geometry in these workshops<br><br><h2> Anthill Workshop 2018</h2><ul<li> Anthill is an annual machine learning conference organised in Bangalore. We presented a 2 Day workshop on "DL and ML for computer Vision" at this conference.
