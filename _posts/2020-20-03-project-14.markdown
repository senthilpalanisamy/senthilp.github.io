description: <h2>Breif Overview</h2> A C++ project for a wheeled robot navigation and SLAM using a EKF filter was constructed from scratch and tested on a turtlebot.<h2>Detailed Explanation</h2> Kinematics for a wheeled robot navigation invloves estimating a robot's movement based control inputs applied. Here, a velocity control was used and the odometric state of the robot was estimated. However, a feedback control gives better results than a feed forward control and hence, the use of wheel encoders improves the accuracy in the robot state estimation. However, our modelling capacity is so limited that this is not useful for long term state estimation. Particulary, factors like wheel slip cannot be modelled through our simple model and the use of SLAM is the reliable solution for long term robot pose and map estimation. SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping, which means that the robot builds a map and localises itself at the same time. While this is a Chicken and egg problem, several framework do exist for solving this problem reliably. One of the well established techniques for doing this is the use of Kalman filters. In this work, I implemented an Extended Kalman Filter. In short, an extended kalman filter uses a Taylor's series approximation for linearising the motion model and measurement model to preserve the gaussin posterior, an essential requirement for a Kalman Filter. It must be noted here, that choice of EKF SLAM was solely based on the problem requirement- for robot localisation in an environment with no / limited prior knowledge. Hence, a dense map is not genereated through this method. Infact, we get only a few landmarks points that are tracked throughout for state estimation. <h2> Work in Progress</h2> SLAM with known data association has been implemented and verified successfully verified under a gazebo simulation. Ground Truth for Landmarks were taken from the simulation. SLAM under an unknown environment with an unknown data association is a work in progress<h2> Code</h2> Code for this work can be found at <a href="https://github.com/senthilpalanisamy/NavigationProject" target="_blank">this github repo</a>
