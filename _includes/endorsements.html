This is indeed a gift for any organization that has several stakeholders with strong opinions. Senthil's performance in such a setting where his, firm but polite manner of communicating technical decisions made him shine in several crucial product development conversations.<br><br> Senthil subsequently backed up his decisions by building our data collection robot and our computer vision parameters. Once again his detail-oriented approach of calibrating the camera and working through all combinations helped us avoid any costly delays.<br><br> In short, Senthil's strong technical fundamentals combined with his brisk and cheerful demeanor in being a team leader are a set of combined skills that make him valuable to any organization.

He stood out in his desire to understand problems at its core, to make significant deep technical contributions with their solutions and his discipline to cement his knowledge (as evidenced by the online courses he completed). I am sure he would excel at Research and/or Development in both Academia and Industry.<br><br> He is extremely open and promotes openness and that made it very easy to work with him. His enthusiasm for ultra marathons and his desire to make an impact on society also was very apparent and also energized a lot of other Solitons.
